  abstract = {Embedded processors, like for example processor macros inside modern
	FPGAs, are becoming widely used in many applications. As soon as
	these devices are deployed in radioactive environments, designers
	need hardening solutions to mitigate radiation-induced errors. When
	low-cost applications have to be developed, the traditional hardware
	redundancy-based approaches exploiting m-way replication and voting
	are no longer viable as too expensive, and new mitigation techniques
	have to be developed. In this paper we present a new approach, based
	on processor duplication, checkpoint and rollback, to detect and
	correct soft errors affecting the memory elements of embedded processors.
	Preliminary fault injection results performed on a PowerPC-based
	system confirmed the efficiency of the approach.},

	dramatic effects. When hardware hardening is not cost-effective,
	software implemented hardware fault tolerance (SIHFT) can be a solution
	to increase SoCs' dependability. However, SIHFT increases the time
	for running the hardened application, and the memory occupation.
	In this paper we propose a method that eliminates the memory overhead,
	using a new approach to instruction hardening and control flow checking
	during the execution of the application, without the need for introducing
	any change in its source code. The proposed method is also non-intrusive,

	on the fault tolerance features of the digital design implemented
	into the SRAM-based FPGA. The methodology includes detection and
	localization of a faulty module in the system and its repair and
	bringing the system back to the state in which it operates correctly.
	The automatic repair process of a faulty module is implemented by
	a partial dynamic reconfiguration driven by a generic controller
	inside the FPGA. The presented methodology was verified on the \{ML506\}
	development board with Virtex5 \{FPGA\} for different types of \{RTL\}
	components. Fault tolerant systems developed by the presented methodology
	were tested by means of the newly developed \{SEU\} simulation framework.
	The framework is based on the \{SEU\} simulation through the \{JTAG\}
	interface and allows us to select the region of the \{FPGA\} where
	the \{SEU\} is placed. The simulator does not require any changes
	in the tested design and is fully independent of the functions in
	the FPGA. The external \{SEU\} generator into \{FPGA\} is implemented
	and its function is verified on an evaluation board \{ML506\} for
	several types of fault tolerant architectures. The experimental results
	show the fault coverage and \{SEU\} occurrence causing faulty behavior

  abstract = { ABSTRACT We review the current understanding of single-event upsets
	(SEUs) in microelectronic devices. In recent years, SEUs have been
	recognized as one of the key reliability concerns for both current
	and future technologies. We identify the major sources of SEUs that
	impact many commercial products: (1) alpha particles in packaging
	materials, (2) background radiation due to cosmic rays, and (3) thermal
	neutrons in certain device materials. The origins of SEUs are examined
	from the standpoint of the fundamental atomic and nuclear interactions
	between the intruding particles (alpha particles, cosmic rays, and
	thermal neutrons) and semiconductor materials. We analyze field funneling,
	which is a key mechanism of charge collection in a device struck
	by an ionizing particle. Next, we formulate how SEU cross sections
	and SEU rates are calculated and discuss how these basic quantities
	are related to experiments. Finally, we summarize the major SEU issues
	regarding modeling, bulk complementary metal oxide semiconductor
	technologies, and research on future, exploratory technologies. },

  abstract = {Hardware fault-insertion test (FIT) is a promising method for system
	reliability test and diagnosis coverage measurement. It improves
	the speed of releasing a quality diagnostic program before manufacturing
	and provides feedbacks of fault tolerance of a very complicated large
	system. Certain level insufficient fault tolerance can be fixed in
	the current system but others may require ASIC or overall system
	architectural modifications. The FIT is achieved by introducing an
	artificial fault (defect modeling) at the pin level of a module to
	mimic any physical defect behavior within the module, such as SEU
	(single event upset) or escaped delay defect. We present a hardware
	architectural solution for pin fault insertion. We also present a
	simulation framework and optimization techniques for a subset of
	module pin selection for FIT, such that desired coverage are obtained
	under the constraints of limited FIT pins due to the costs of the
	associated implementation. Experimental results are presented for
	selected ISCAS and OpenCore benchmarks, as well as for an industrial
	circuit.},
